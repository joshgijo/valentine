    <p class="journey-text">
        From our first meeting, where we barely spoke, to becoming best friends, our bond has grown with each passing moment.
        We shared laughter, inside jokes, and unforgettable memories. As time passed, you became not just my friend, but my soulmate.
        Through the highs and lows, we've been there for each other, and now, I can't imagine my life without you.
